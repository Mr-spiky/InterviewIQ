# Implementation Plan - Install Firecrawl MCP

The goal is to install the Firecrawl MCP server and document the process so the agent can use it.

## Proposed Changes

### Documentation
#### [NEW] [firecrawl_mcp.md](file:///d:/Shivam/web%20development/Project/Antigravity%20setup/docs/firecrawl_mcp.md)
- Save the provided Firecrawl MCP documentation for future reference.

### Configuration
#### [MODIFY] `mcp_config.json` (location to be determined)
- Add Firecrawl MCP configuration with `npx` command.
- *Note*: User needs to provide API Key or I need to use a placeholder and ask user to fill it. The user said "agent will figure out how to how to actually install...". I'll check if I can find where to put the key. The docs say `env FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=...`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- Check if `mcp_config.json` is updated correctly.
- User might need to restart/reload to see the new server.
