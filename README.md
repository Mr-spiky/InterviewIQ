**InterviewIQ** is an end-to-end, AI-powered mock interview platform that autonomously conducts personalized interviews tailored exactly to your resume, target role, and experience level. Rather than serving scripted Q&A, InterviewIQ dynamically adjusts its questioning based on your live responses, simulating the pressure and nuance of a real tech interview.

Built with a striking **Neo-Brutalist** design system (inspired by modern developer tools), it aims to make interview preparation engaging, rigorous, and highly actionable.

## 📁 Project Structure

InterviewIQ is architected around a highly modular component structure.

```

├── lib/                  # Shared utilities and centralized data logic
│   └── constants.ts      # Single source of truth for mock data, roles, levels, and static content

    ├── setup/            # Components specific to the /setup route (ResumeUpload, RoundTypePicker)
    └── interview/        # Components specific to the live /interview route (ChatMessage, ChatInput, InterviewSidebar)
```

## 🎨 Design Philosophy (Neo-Brutalism)

The UI explicitly rejects standard flat design in favor of **Neo-Brutalism**. 
Key design tokens include:
- `bg-dark` (`#0F0F0F`) body background with `text-white`
- Accent color `text-lime` (`#C8F135`) for severe contrast
- Thick 3px solid black or white borders (`border-3`)
- Hard drop shadows without blur (`shadow-[4px_4px_0px_#000]`)
- Uppercase typography using **Space Grotesk** for headings and **Inter** for readable body text.
